TARDIS Date
===========

The TARDIS Date module integrates the TARDIS with date fields, allowing lists of
nodes organized by year and month based on custom date fields in the TARDIS
query.

Instructions:
1. Activate the module in example.com/admin/modules (hint: it's in the "TARDIS")
group.

2. Visit example.com/admin/structure/tardis and scroll to the bottom. You'll see
a new vertical tab called "TARDIS Date". From there, select a date field with
which to render the TARDIS page and block.

3. Keep in mind that the TARDIS will only filter *one* date field, so node types
that do not posess the chosen field will not show up in the TARDIS query.
