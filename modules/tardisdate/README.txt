TARDIS Date
===========

The TARDIS Date module adds date field functionality for TARDIS results. Now
you can filter results using any date field!

Here's how you do it:
1. Activate the module in example.com/admin/modules (hint: it's in the "TARDIS")
group.

2. Visit example.com/admin/structure/tardis and scroll to the bottom. You'll see
a new vertical tab called "TARDIS Date". Choose a desired date field in "Date
field to use ".

3. Save and profit!
