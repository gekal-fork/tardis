TARDIS Internationalization
===========================

The TARDIS Internationalization module allows language filtering for the nodes
retrieved from the TARDIS query.

Now you can not only time travel to any node in the past, but also anywhere in
the world! ;)

Here's how you do it:
1. Activate the module in example.com/admin/modules (hint: it's in the "TARDIS")
group.

2. Visit example.com/admin/structure/tardis and scroll to the bottom. You'll see
a new option called "Languages". Choose your language(s) accordingly. There's
also "Current language" and "Undefined" for fine-tuning of results.

3. Save and profit!
