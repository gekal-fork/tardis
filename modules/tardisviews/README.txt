TARDIS Views
============

The TARDIS Views module adds a neat display style plugin for Views which renders
a TARDIS list of links.

Here's how you do it:
1. Activate the module in example.com/admin/modules (hint: it's in the "TARDIS")
group.

2. Create a new view (or edit an existing one). Under "Format", choose "TARDIS
Views month list".

3. Under "Link path" set the address of a view page which accepts "year" and
"month" as contextual filters. That's it: You're all set!

4. The module ships with a default view, which you can use for reference. Look it
up in example.com/admin/structure/views/view/tardis/edit.
